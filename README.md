My Database Schema:

A user can post many jobs as well as search for many jobs. My plan is to implement Roles to the Users where if the Role is an Employer they can post jobs and search for job. If the Role is an Job Seeker/other then the User can only search for jobs.

My wireframe for my frontend on the Employers view, will have the fields which they can put in information and the job will be posted on the Job Board.

My plan for the Employee/Job Seeker is to have a search bar where a Job Title will be entered and it will filter through all the results and return Job titles that match the search term.
